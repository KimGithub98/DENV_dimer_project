Protocol to run the genetic algorithm and score it

Step 1: fill in the desired population number, register, length, number of iterations, r_cross, r_mut and PCCneg_sel_weight (does nothing)
Step 2: change the runname to save the run without overwriting it
Step 3: run the genetic algorithm, for every generation it prints the best sequence with a score. The end population is saved as fasta

Sequence Logo/ Interaction profile
Step 1: to create a sequence logo run Sequence_logo_designed_CCs.py
Step 2: To create interaction profiles of the final population run Interaction profile GA output.py
