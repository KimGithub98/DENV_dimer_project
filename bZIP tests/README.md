Protocol score testing bZIPs
Step 1: Run bZIP.py to prepare the data fo the bZIPs
Step 2: Score the bZIPs based on the Relative and Non-relative scores by running "scoring genetic algorithm_bZIP_R.py" and "scoring genetic algorithm_bZIP_NR.py"
Step 3: calculate correlation of bZIP affinity and scores by running bZIP_correlation_RandNR.R and make figures using bZIP_correlation_average_plots.R
Step 4: Score bZIPs on total score by running scoring genetic algorihtm_bZIP_final.py
Step 5: visualize correlation and calculate correlation of final score and bZIPs by running Final_score_bZIP_correlation.R
